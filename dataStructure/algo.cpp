/*
 * Data Structure	Description

  Vector	Stores elements like an array but can dynamically change in size. Adding and removing of elements are usually done at the end. Elements can be accessed by index.

  List	Stores elements sequentially, where each element is connected to the next. Adding and removing of elements can be done at both ends. Not accessible by index.

  Stack	Stores elements in a specific order, called LIFO (Last In, First Out), where elements can only be added and removed from the top. Not accessible by index.

  Queue	Stores elements in a specific order, called FIFO (First In, First Out), where elements are added at the end and removed from the front. Not accessible by index.

  Deque	Stores elements in a double-ended queue, where elements can be added and removed from both ends. Elements can be accessed by index.

  Set	Stores unique elements. Not accessible by index.

  Map	Stores elements in "key/value" pairs. Accessible by keys (not by index).
